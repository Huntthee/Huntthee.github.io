      <h3>TheDesertWhale</h3>
      <p>A wonderful little commissions and portfolio site for TheDesertWhale's art! This site was fun to build from scratch and upgrade as my knowledge expanded. It started as plain HTML/CSS, and grew to be what it is now! However there's always more to do!</p>
      <p>Built with EJS/JS/SCSS and hosted on Heroku for a beautiful, fast and responsive website.</p>

      <h3>GameGearGuru</h3>
      <p>My blogging/affiliate site for everything gaming! Where I occasionally post reviews, opinion and news about video games, accessories and the gaming world! The idea and motivation to create this site is what eventually drove me to start learning code, and brought me to where I am now!</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/smaller-pic.jpg" alt="Mike throwing horns in a small round profile picture" height="160" width="160" loading="lazy">
    <p>Hello, I'm Mike! I have recently entered the world of IT and love the possibilities that have opened up before me with the technologies now at my fingertips.</p>
    <p>I spent most of 2020 setting up my own blog via GoDaddy/WordPress before becoming more and more curious about how these programs were working. Which led me to start learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
    <p>By September that year I was convinced that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life! And so I enrolled in SAIT's Web Development program, and completed that in Spring of 2021.</p>
    <p>With an aim to specialize in react development, there's nothing I enjoy more than learning and playing with code. Every day challenging myself to create or learn something new, and add it to my growing toolset.</p>
