            <h3 class="post-title">Where it all began</h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>In May of 2020 I began looking into ways of setting up a small personal blog about gaming and related equipment which I could then turn into a small affiliate-marketing site.</p>
              <p>I began to stream, record and upload videos of my gameplay, and blog about the events that transpired in the games I was playing or had played before. That led into a more serious
                 take on streaming and the possibilities that lie with being a twitch affiliate or partner.</p>
              <p>But I still wanted to build my website, and I found Godaddy to be far too limiting, so I switched to
                  WordPress and now have a much prettier finished product.</p>
              <p>I then taught myself how to manage and update my site, and continue to learn how to improve its performance and SEO.</p>
              <p>But I kept stumbling across terms like '<em>insert HTML</em>' or '<em>insert custom CSS</em>' and knew there was still more, so I began to teach myself code.</p>
              <p>Starting with lessons on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>, and supplemented with practice on coding apps like <a href="https://www.getmimo.com">Mimo</a>. I then chose to enroll in a Web Development course at my local college.</p>
