## This website is intended to be used as my portfolio website and final project for the SAIT Web Dev course.

Throughout my time spent attending the SAIT courses I will apply the knowledge I gain to this website and expand its functionality, usability and accessbility.

Currently the site is built on flexbox, but I have plans to integrate some Grid, or perhaps migrate entirely to grid, with some flexbox. Time will tell!

NO JavaScript... yet.
