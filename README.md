### Intents
This website has been created and maintained by Mike Allison for the purpose of displaying all the information one would need to learn about me, what I can do, and how to reach me for more information if needed.

I will be building this website as a final project piece for my time at SAIT, and aim to continue to use and develop the site as my web development career continues.

### Roadmap

The roadmap for the site is as follows, and I have no particular order for when changes will be implemented or rolled out. If I get some new ideas, they may be coded in first!

- Some Icons to spruce up the landing page
- Better colors
- Actual photo of me for background image
- Build Resume section
- Build Portfolio section
- Create and link Contact form
- Some kind of Call to Action for the landing page.
- Mobile friendliness/Hamburger menu for smaller screens
