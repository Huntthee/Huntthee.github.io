# 😎 A Wonderful Personal Profile Site 🤘
**&copy;  Mike Allison 2021**

## Just A Simple Thing
Keeping it clean and simple, this site is a one page static website hosted on GitHub Pages for my personal use!

Here I shall keep track of the various projects I work on/complete. As well as the languages and technologies I learn along the way!

## Inspiration ☀️
I whipped up this profile site after stumbling across a design I liked on Canva. 🖌️

With one tab open on the canva design and my VS and Live Server going on my other screen. I pieced together my site based on the looks of the design and all the things I wanted to include in my profile.

If you would like to use this design as a template for your own site go ahead!
