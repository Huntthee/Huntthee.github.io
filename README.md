## This website is intended to be used as my portfolio website and final project for the SAIT Web Dev course.

Throughout my time spent attending the SAIT courses I will apply the knowledge I gain to this website and expand its functionality, usability and accessbility.

Currently the site is built on flexbox, but I have plans to integrate some Grid, or perhaps migrate entirely to grid, with some flexbox. Time will tell!

NO JavaScript... yet. I may use some for the eventual Hamburger menu.

Have a good looking, responsive page to use as a base for any future changes.

I may come back and tweak the overall color scheme and images, as most have been created/found in Canva in ~5mins and are meant to be placeholders for the finished product.

Right now the code is still brute force, but ready for some cleanup!
