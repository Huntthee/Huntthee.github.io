## This website is intended to be used as my portfolio website and final project for the SAIT Web Dev course.

Throughout my time spent attending the SAIT courses I will apply the knowledge I gain to this website and expand its functionality, usability and accessbility.

Currently the site is built on flexbox, but I have plans to integrate some Grid, or perhaps migrate entirely to grid, with some flexbox. Time will tell!

NO JavaScript... yet. I may use some for the eventual Hamburger menu.
(Ended up doing the checkbox hack instead! works well enough)

Have a good looking, responsive page to use as a base for any future changes. Coming along nicely so far! Need to add Resume page and make sure it's printable.

I may come back and tweak the overall color scheme and images, as most have been created/found in Canva in ~5mins and are meant to be placeholders for the finished product.

Right now the code is still brute force, some cleanup has been done but theres always more that can be done!
